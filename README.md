# sportease-monolith

This repository contains the monolithic backend for the Sportease application.  
Designed following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and structured around clearly defined domain layers, the system implements a layered monolithic architecture that preserves modularity, maintainability, and scalability within a single deployable unit.
The application integrates all core functionalities — including user management, scheduling, activity tracking, and performance monitoring — within a single cohesive codebase, enabling fast development and efficient coordination between components.
